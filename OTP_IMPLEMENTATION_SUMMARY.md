# OTP Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented OTP (One-Time Password) functionality for both registration and login using the Brevo API (formerly Sendinblue). Users can now verify their email addresses through a 6-digit OTP code sent directly to their inbox.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Backend Implementation

1. **Brevo Email Service** (`microservices/auth_service/app/Services/BrevoEmailService.php`)

   - Created professional email service using Brevo API
   - Supports three email templates:
     - Registration OTP email
     - Login OTP email
     - Email verification link (legacy support)
   - Beautiful HTML templates with branding
   - Error handling and logging

2. **Updated AuthController** (`microservices/auth_service/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`)

   - Integrated BrevoEmailService via dependency injection
   - Updated registration to automatically send OTP
   - Enhanced OTP sending with Brevo integration
   - Added login OTP request and verification methods

3. **New API Endpoints** (`microservices/auth_service/routes/api.php`)
   ```
   POST /api/send-otp           - Send/resend OTP for registration
   POST /api/verify-otp         - Verify OTP and activate account
   POST /api/request-login-otp  - Request OTP for passwordless login
   POST /api/login-with-otp     - Login using OTP instead of password
   ```

### OTP Features

- **6-digit numeric OTP** for enhanced security
- **10-minute expiration** to prevent abuse
- **One-time use** - OTPs are invalidated after use
- **Automatic invalidation** of old OTPs when requesting new ones
- **Type-specific OTPs** - separate for registration (`email_verification`) and login (`login`)

### Frontend Integration

The frontend (`GSM/src/pages/GatewayLogin.tsx`) already includes:

- OTP modal with 6-digit input fields
- 5-minute countdown timer
- Resend OTP functionality
- Automatic display after registration
- Visual feedback and notifications

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Brevo API

1. **Create Brevo Account**

   - Visit [https://www.brevo.com/](https://www.brevo.com/)
   - Sign up for free account (300 emails/day on free tier)
   - Verify your email

2. **Get API Key**

   - Go to Settings → SMTP & API → API Keys
   - Generate new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `xkeysib-`)

3. **Verify Sender Email**
   - Go to Senders section
   - Add and verify your sender email
   - Complete verification process

### Step 2: Configure Laravel Environment

Create/update `.env` file in `microservices/auth_service/`:

```env
# Brevo Configuration
BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-your-actual-api-key-here
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@govserveph.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME=GoServePH

# Database Configuration
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=auth_service
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# App Configuration
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations

```bash
cd microservices/auth_service
php artisan migrate
```

This ensures the `otp_verifications` table exists.

### Step 4: Start the Service

```bash
cd microservices/auth_service
php artisan serve --port=8000
```

### Step 5: Test the Flow

1. **Test Registration:**

   - Open frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Register"
   - Fill in registration form
   - Submit form
   - Check email for OTP
   - Enter OTP in modal
   - Account should be verified

2. **Test OTP Login:**
   - Use `/api/request-login-otp` endpoint
   - Check email for OTP
   - Use `/api/login-with-otp` with the OTP

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### OTP Emails Not Sending

**Problem:** OTP emails not arriving in inbox

**Solutions:**

1. Check Brevo API key is correct in `.env`
2. Verify sender email is verified in Brevo dashboard
3. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. Check spam/junk folder
5. Verify Brevo account is active

### Invalid or Expired OTP

**Problem:** OTP shows as invalid or expired

**Solutions:**

1. Check system time is correct (OTP expiration time-sensitive)
2. Request new OTP (old ones are invalidated)
3. Ensure OTP was entered within 5 minutes
4. Verify OTP hasn't been used already

### Database Errors

**Problem:** Migration or OTP storage errors

**Solutions:**

1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
2. Check database connection in `.env`
3. Verify MySQL is running
4. Check table exists: `otp_verifications`
