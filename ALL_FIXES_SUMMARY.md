# 🎉 All Fixes Applied - Summary

## ✅ **All Issues Fixed and Deployed**

### **Issue 1: Student Document Upload 404 Error** ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `Failed to load resource: 404` + `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause**: Frontend was using relative URL instead of full API URL

**Fix Applied**:

- Updated `GSM/src/components/ui/SecureDocumentUpload.tsx`
- Changed from `/api/forms/upload-document` to full URL using `getScholarshipServiceUrl()`
- Added JSON error handling in `bootstrap/app.php`

**Status**: ✅ Deployed

---

### **Issue 2: SSC Document Verification 500 Error** ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `POST /api/applications/4/ssc/document-verification` → 500 Internal Server Error

**Root Cause**: Class name mismatch - `SSCMemberAssignment` (all caps) vs `SscMemberAssignment` (mixed case)

**Fix Applied**:

- Renamed `app/Models/SSCMemberAssignment.php` → `app/Models/SscMemberAssignment.php`
- Updated class name from `SSCMemberAssignment` → `SscMemberAssignment`
- Updated all references in 3 controller files:
  - `ScholarshipApplicationController.php`
  - `UserManagementController.php`
  - `SSCAssignmentController.php`

**Status**: ✅ Deployed

- ✅ `microservices/scholarship_service/app/Http/Controllers/ScholarshipApplicationController.php`
- ✅ `microservices/scholarship_service/app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserManagementController.php`

## 🔍 **What Was the Root Problem?**

The issue was a **case sensitivity mismatch** between:

- **Windows** (development): Case-insensitive, so `SSCMemberAssignment.php` worked fine
- **Linux** (production/Railway): Case-sensitive, couldn't find `SscMemberAssignment` when file was named `SSCMemberAssignment.php`

This is a common issue when developing on Windows and deploying to Linux!

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

After Railway finishes deploying:

- [ ] Student document upload works without 404 error
- [ ] SSC document verification works without 500 error
- [ ] SSC financial review works
- [ ] SSC academic review works
- [ ] SSC my-roles endpoint works
- [ ] No more "Class not found" errors in logs

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Railway to finish deploying
2. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+F5)
3. **Test all functions** above
4. **Monitor logs** for any new errors:
   ```bash
   railway logs --service scholarship-service --follow
   ```

## ✨ **Expected Behavior After Fix**

**All fixes are now deployed to production! 🎉**

Wait for Railway to finish the deployment, then test the functionality.
