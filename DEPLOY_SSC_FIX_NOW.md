# 🚨 DEPLOY SSC ASSIGNMENT FIX - Action Required

## Problem Found

❌ Budget Department, Education Affairs, and Chairperson users have NO assignments  
❌ Applications cannot proceed past document verification stage

## Solution Ready ✅

All code fixes and scripts are ready to deploy!

---

## 🎯 DEPLOY NOW - Choose Your Method

### Method 1: Automated Script (Easiest - 5 minutes)

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy-ssc-fix-railway.sh

# Run it
./deploy-ssc-fix-railway.sh
```

This will:

1. Commit all changes
2. Push to Railway
3. Wait for deployment
4. Run the fix script automatically

---

### Method 2: Manual Steps (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Deploy Code Changes

```bash
git add microservices/scholarship_service/app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserManagementController.php
git add microservices/scholarship_service/fix_ssc_assignments.php
git add fix-ssc-assignments.sql
git add SSC_ASSIGNMENT_*.md
git add deploy-ssc-fix-railway.sh
git commit -m "Fix: SSC member assignments for all roles"
git push origin main
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to auto-deploy.

#### Step 2: Run Fix Script

**Option A: Via Railway CLI**

```bash
railway run php microservices/scholarship_service/fix_ssc_assignments.php
```

**Option B: Via Railway Console**

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Open scholarship service
3. Click "Deploy Logs" and wait for deployment to complete
4. In Railway console, run:
   ```bash
   php microservices/scholarship_service/fix_ssc_assignments.php
   ```

**Option C: Direct Database Insert**

```sql
-- Find your SSC user IDs from auth service first
-- Then run (replace user_ids with actual values):

INSERT INTO ssc_member_assignments (user_id, ssc_role, review_stage, is_active, assigned_at, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES
  (5, 'budget_dept', 'financial_review', 1, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),
  (8, 'education_affairs', 'academic_review', 1, NOW(), NOW(), NOW()),
  (1, 'chairperson', 'final_approval', 1, NOW(), NOW(), NOW())
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE updated_at = NOW();
```

#### Step 3: Verify

```sql
SELECT
    review_stage,
    ssc_role,
    COUNT(*) as members
FROM ssc_member_assignments
WHERE is_active = 1
GROUP BY review_stage, ssc_role;
```

✅ Expected Results:

```
document_verification | city_council        | 1+
financial_review      | budget_dept         | 1+
academic_review       | education_affairs   | 1+
final_approval        | chairperson         | 1+
```

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Code Change

**File:** `microservices/scholarship_service/app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserManagementController.php`

**Issue:** Line 510-512 was checking if user had ANY assignment  
**Fix:** Now checks if user has assignment for THIS SPECIFIC role

**Before:**

```php
$existingAssignment = SscMemberAssignment::where('user_id', $userId)
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->first();
```

**After:**

```php
$existingAssignment = SscMemberAssignment::where('user_id', $userId)
    ->where('ssc_role', $mapping['ssc_role'])  // ← Added this check
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->first();
```

**Also Fixed:** Changed `budget_department` to `budget_dept` (correct enum value)

## 🔍 How to Test After Deployment

### Test 1: Verify Existing Assignments

```sql
SELECT
    u.id as user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.role as auth_role,
    sma.ssc_role,
    sma.review_stage,
    sma.is_active
FROM auth_service.users u
LEFT JOIN ssc_member_assignments sma ON u.id = sma.user_id AND sma.is_active = 1
WHERE u.role IN ('ssc', 'ssc_city_council', 'ssc_budget_dept', 'ssc_education_affairs')
ORDER BY u.role, u.id;
```

✅ **Every SSC user should have an assignment**

### Test 2: Create New SSC User

```json
POST /api/users
{
  "citizen_id": "SSC-TEST-001",
  "email": "test.budget@example.com",
  "role": "ssc_budget_dept",
  "first_name": "Test",
  "last_name": "Budget"
}
```

Then verify:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ssc_member_assignments
WHERE user_id = [new_user_id];
```

✅ **Should show:** `budget_dept` | `financial_review` | active

### Test 3: SSC Workflow

1. Submit a scholarship application
2. Verify it goes through all stages:
   - ✅ Document Verification (city_council)
   - ✅ Financial Review (budget_dept)
   - ✅ Academic Review (education_affairs)
   - ✅ Final Approval (chairperson)

    GROUP BY user_id, ssc_role
);
```

- [ ] Fix script executed successfully
- [ ] Database has assignments for all 4 stages:
  - [ ] document_verification
  - [ ] financial_review
  - [ ] academic_review
  - [ ] final_approval
- [ ] Test user creation works
- [ ] Test SSC workflow completes all stages
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs

## 🆘 Support

### If Script Fails

**Error: "Cannot connect to auth service"**

- Check `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` environment variable in Railway
- Verify auth service is running

**Error: "Duplicate entry"**

- This is OK - means assignment already exists
- Script will skip and continue

**Error: "No SSC users found"**

- Verify users exist with SSC roles in auth service
- Check auth service endpoint `/api/internal/users` is accessible

### Need Help?

1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Check database connectivity
3. Review `SSC_ASSIGNMENT_FIX_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting
4. Verify all environment variables are set

---

## 🎯 Priority: HIGH

This fix is critical because:

- ❌ Applications are currently stuck at document verification
- ❌ Later review stages have no assigned reviewers
- ❌ Complete SSC workflow is non-functional

**Estimated deployment time:** 5-10 minutes  
**Estimated testing time:** 5 minutes  
**Total downtime:** None (hot deployment)
