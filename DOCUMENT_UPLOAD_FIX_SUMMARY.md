# 📋 Document Upload Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Error**: `404 Not Found` + `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause**: Frontend was using relative URL `/api/forms/upload-document` which pointed to the wrong domain.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Backend (2 files)

✅ `microservices/scholarship_service/bootstrap/app.php`

- Added JSON error response handler for all API routes
- Prevents HTML error pages on API endpoints

✅ `microservices/scholarship_service/routes/api.php`

- Route already exists (no changes needed)
- Added test endpoint for debugging

### 2. Frontend (1 file)

✅ `GSM/src/components/ui/SecureDocumentUpload.tsx`

- Imported API config helpers
- Changed from relative URL to full API URL using `getScholarshipServiceUrl()`
- Now correctly points to: `https://scholarship-gsph.up.railway.app/api/forms/upload-document`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd microservices/scholarship_service
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd GSM
   npm run build
   # Deploy the build
   ```

3. **Test**:
   - Log in as a student
   - Try uploading a document
   - Check Network tab - should see request to `https://scholarship-gsph.up.railway.app/api/forms/upload-document`
   - Should get JSON response with `success: true`

## 📊 Expected Result

**Before Fix**:

- ❌ Request to `/api/forms/upload-document` on frontend domain
- ❌ 404 HTML response
- ❌ JSON parse error
- ❌ Upload fails
