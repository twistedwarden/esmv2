# SSC Workflow Implementation - Complete

## Overview

The SSC (Scholarship Screening Committee) workflow system has been successfully implemented. This system allows SSC members to review scholarship applications that have been endorsed by administrators, make decisions (approve/reject), and manage the complete approval workflow.

## Implementation Summary

- Fields: id, application_id, decision, approved_amount, notes, rejection_reason, decided_by, decided_at

#### 2. SSC Decision Model

- **File**: `microservices/scholarship_service/app/Models/SscDecision.php`
- Eloquent model for SSC decisions
- Relationships with ScholarshipApplication

- `sscBulkApprove()` - Bulk approve multiple applications
- `sscBulkReject()` - Bulk reject multiple applications
- `getSscStatistics()` - Get dashboard statistics
- `getSscDecisionHistory()` - Get decision history with filters

#### 5. API Routes

- **File**: `microservices/scholarship_service/routes/api.php`
- `GET /api/applications/ssc/pending` - List pending applications
- `GET /api/applications/ssc/statistics` - Get statistics

  - Bulk selection with checkboxes
  - Individual approve/reject with modals
  - Bulk approve/reject operations

  - Filter by decision type and date range
  - Sortable table view
  - Export to CSV functionality
  - Detailed decision view modal
  - Shows all decision metadata

## Key Features

### Application Review Workflow

1. **View Applications**: SSC members see all applications with status 'endorsed_to_ssc'
2. **Review Details**: View complete student information, academic records, interview evaluations
3. **Make Decision**: Approve (with amount) or Reject (with reason)
4. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple applications and approve/reject in batch
5. **Track History**: All decisions logged with timestamps and notes

### Interview Evaluation Display

Applications show comprehensive interview evaluation data:

- **Scores** (1-5 stars): Academic Motivation, Leadership, Financial Need, Character
- **Recommendation**: Recommended, Conditional, or Not Recommended
- **Interview Notes**: Remarks, strengths, areas for improvement

### Status Flow

```
endorsed_to_ssc → [SSC Review] → approved/rejected
```

### Data Tracking

Every SSC decision creates:

1. `ssc_decisions` record (decision, amount/reason, timestamp)
2. `application_status_history` record (audit trail)
3. Updated `scholarship_applications` record (new status, approved amount/rejection reason)

## UI/UX Highlights

- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode compatibility
- **Consistent Design**: Matches existing admin panel style (EndorseToSSC pattern)
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback for all actions
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Statistics & Reporting

### Dashboard Metrics

- Total Applications (all time)
- Pending Review (awaiting SSC decision)
- Approved (total approved)
- Rejected (total rejected)
- This Month Decisions (decisions made this month)
- Average Processing Time (days from endorsement to decision)

### Export Capabilities

- Decision History: Export to CSV with all decision metadata
- Includes: Application number, student name, decision, amount, date, notes/reason

## Security & Audit

- All decisions tracked with `decided_by` (user ID)
- Timestamps for all operations
- Complete audit trail in `application_status_history`
- Amount validation (approved amount ≤ requested amount)
- Required rejection reason for transparency
